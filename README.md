# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code :christmas_tree:

![Adventofcode](./shared/images/adventofcode.png)

This is a repo for solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is an advent calendar with small, daily programming puzzles with a christmas-theme. Solving the puzzles will unlock a code which you use to progress and unlock the next challenges.

Challenges gets progressively harder as we get closer and closer to christmas day, but  __don't give up!__ 

And remember - santa will be watching :santa:

#### How to join?
Anyone at NEP with rudimentary programming  skills (or who are eager to learn) and the _ability to read_ are more than welcome to join!

Simply create a folder in the root directory with your name, and put your solutions and setup there.
Use whatever programming language and environment you prefer. Feel free to copy the setups other people are using if you need help to get going.

----
#### Using git and the repo
A good idea is to create a branch for every daily challenge you solve.

#### Leaderboard
Register at https://adventofcode.com/ with your GitHub-account, and then enter `459312-7760e63c` as a code to join the leaderboard.

Once you have joined, you can view the leaderboard [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/459312?order=stars) and see your rank.
In order to get the most stars, solve the challenges before anyone else does. Then you will collect more stars! :star2::star2:

#### Rules
The rules for the calendar itself are laid out [here](https://adventofcode.com/about). Our only rule _here_ is to have fun though, and to __use the repo__. If you just submit the codes at the website without showing us how you solved it, your score will be discarded. 

Other than that, feel free to use any programming language you like (or solve the challenges in several even...), look at what others are doing and take inspiration and whatnot.

##### Happy coding! :tada::christmas_tree::bell::gift:
